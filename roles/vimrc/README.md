The role copies a file called .vimrc to the home directory of the user who executes the playbook.

The role has only one task. The task is named "Copy .vimrc into place". The task has two parameters:

src: files/.vimrc - This parameter tells Ansible to look for a file called .vimrc in a folder called files in the same directory as the playbook.
dest: ~/.vimrc - This parameter tells Ansible to copy the file into the home directory of the user who executes the playbook.
The task uses the copy module, which is one of the many modules in Ansible's library of hundreds of modules. The copy module copies a file from one location to another.
